Milestone Project 4, for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Diploma in Web App Development.

Morgan & Co (website link here), is a family-run furniture retailer based in Wales, UK. The company specializes in sofas, 
chairs, tables and other home furnishings. For many ficticious years, the company has operated through word-of-mouth 
and a strong family reputation with steady growth eventually leading them to be a leader in their industry - proudly 
displaying thier motto of "if it can fit through your front door, we'll sell it, if not, we'll take the door off - free 
of charge". After a recent intervention the family have decided to take a leap of faith into last century and launch a 
company website to further boost sales.
